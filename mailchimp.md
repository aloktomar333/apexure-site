  the box. All we need is your Mailchimp API Key to get started. When building landing
  pages in [Unbounce](https://www.apexure.com/unbounce-landing-page-designer/) we
  integrate with Mailchimp and map the fields with form elements. We also include
  hidden fields which can help to analyse and segment users in Mailchimp.

  apps which work seamlessly with custom built [Wordpress sites](https://www.apexure.com/wordpress-web-design).

feature-type-4-heading: Split Testing
feature-type-4-description: To maximise conversions/sign-ups we use split testing
  to check which variation converts the best. A typical example could be to test a
  variation with few form fields e.g. just email or you can come up with a variation
  where the page length is different. There are lots of tests you can run and as an
  agency we specialise in setting up tests which are effective.

feature-type-5-description: Ensure the first text users read has the punch to attract
  them and grab their attention. This will help to users to sign-up on the page later
  on which will bring them into your email system.

feature-type-6-heading: Social Proof
feature-type-6-description: A reinforcing customer quote or testimonial with real
  photos. If you don't have testimonials can you prepare a stat which has the numbers
  of users/customers. As shown by research, people really like looking at human faces
  on the web, and testimonials are more likely to be trusted when they include a photo
  of the person quoting it. You could also include video testimonials from your top
  customers and showcase them on your page.

feature-type-7-description: 'Another great way to add social proof is by adding social
  media count boxes.  The boxes that display the number of people that have liked
  your brand across channels like Facebook or Twitter. Those numbers can’t be faked. '

feature-type-9-description: Another important factor to include is a bulleted list

  out canned emails. Part of your automation could also involve human interaction.
