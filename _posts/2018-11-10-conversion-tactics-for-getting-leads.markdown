Before we dive into why your website is not converting, you need to ensure your website is set up to track conversions. If you have set up goals in Google analytics, you can skip to the next section. If this is the first time you have read about Goals in Google conversion, then read along.

The most straightforward way to track conversions is via Google Analytics. Here is a step-by-step guide to setting up a Google Analytics goal for a Lead Gen form.

> ##### 1. Create a thank you page which links to your main lead gen page.
>
> If you are using a tool like Unbounce or Clickfunnels you can easily create a new page and link it.
>
> ![thank-you-page-link.jpg](/images/thank-you-page-link.jpg)
>
> If you have a Wordpress website you can use various plugins to redirect the user to a thank you page once the form is submitted.

### 2. Copy the thank you page URL and go to your Google Analytics Admin and click Goals.

### 3. Create a new Goal and use the URL of the thank you page.

> 

Create a new Goal and use the URL of the thank you page as the destination. Once set you can now track goals/conversions in Google Analytics.

##### Does your Call-to-Action button on the website stand out?

With a demand to capture users' attention, you also need to drive them to the next logical step. Whether it's adding a product to the basket, viewing more info, or downloading an E-book, you need to define action-focused buttons to guide visitors. The buttons on the page should stand out from the rest of the design and should look like actual clickable buttons. Here are some tips which will help you to look at your call-to-action buttons:

* What stands out gets clicked (call-to-action buttons or links shouldn't be the same as the rest of your design).

* CTA button should create a sense of urgency that guide your visitors towards your goal conversion.

* Move your seal or badge closer to the desired action (like the “Place Order” button).

* Adding directional cues assists in focusing the visitor’s attention on the buttons.

* Always test the position of your call-to-action button. With simple A/B tests check if the page performs better when the position of the button is on the left, right or middle of the section.

> ##### Do you have a low traffic website?
>
> Low traffic means a low number of conversions. Even with an optimised website, you can't expect all visitors to fill out a form or buy a product. However, what you can do is increase your traffic from hundreds to tens of thousands of visitors.  Traffic can be increased by:
>
> ##### - Paid Ads
>
> ![paid-ads.jpg](/images/paid-ads.jpg)
> This is a no-brainer. The more money you spend on Google and Facebook ads the more traffic you will generate. As this can easily burn a hole in your marketing spend, its best to use paid traffic as only one of your traffic channels.
>
> ##### - SEO
>
> ![seo.jpg](/images/seo.jpg)
> Using Search Engine Optimisation you can build traffic for free. Although it’s free traffic, you will have still invest time, money and effort in getting indexed in Google. SEO techniques such as off-page (link building) and on-page (optimising web pages so search engines can rank it) are difficult to master as Google changes search algorithms quite frequently. However, nothing is impossible and with effort and perseverance comes reward.

> ##### - Content Marketing
>
> ![content-marketing.jpg](/images/content-marketing.jpg)
> An ecosystem which puts your brand in front of your target audience. By using tools such as blogs, podcasts and YouTube you can increase awareness and generate traffic. I will strongly recommend checking out Content Machine in which Dan Norris the author used Content Marketing to Build a 7-figure Business With Zero Advertising.

##### Do visitors trust your brand, when they visit your website?

According to a study by Econsultancy, physical address, contact phone number, and email address are the top three credibility signals for any website. Clearly displayed contact details subconsciously assures users that there is a real business behind a website. One of the best ways to add contact details is to incorporate an effective contact us page within your website. A [contact us page](https://www.apexure.com/contact-us/) is an integral part of a website allowing users - the customers, investors, or perhaps advertisers - to get in contact with you. As a business owner, having a contact us page converts users into [leads for your business](apexure.com/lead-capture-page-template/).

##### Best practices to follow while creating your contact us page:

<div id="best_practice">
<div class="best_practice_inner">
<h4>1. Use everyday language</h4>
<p>Keep your writing simple, use terms that can be easily recognised by your visitors. The three most widely used words are “Support,” “Help” and “Contact Us.”</p>
</div>
<div class="best_practice_inner">
<h4>2. Avoid grammatical errors</h4>
<p>Even small grammatical errors can make a negative impression on your visitors. Double check your contact page before publishing it on your website.</p>
</div>
<div class="best_practice_inner">
<h4>3. Make it easy to find</h4>
<p>Links to the contact page should appear in the header or the footer of the website. You should always make the contact link easier to find on the page.</p>
</div>
<div class="best_practice_inner">
<h4>4. Make it look good</h4>
<p>Never underestimate the power of a visually appealing contact page. While the page may be simple, careful thought must still go into its design.</p>
</div>
<div class="best_practice_inner">
<h4>5. Make it mobile Responsive</h4>
<p>Since the number of people using mobile devices to access the web has surpassed desktop users, make sure your contact page looks good on all mobile devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="best_practice_inner">
<h4>6. Add a Google map</h4>
<p>Adding a Google map on your Contact Us page helps visitors easily enter the Google interface and request directions directly from their home/office.</p>
</div>
<div class="best_practice_inner">
<h4>7. Add Privacy Policy Details</h4>
<p>Post-GDPR, make it easier to find and view Privacy Policy details across your site. Especially when asking for contact info from your visitors, have a simple yet solid optin-message so visitors are not left in any doubt.</p>
</div>
<div class="best_practice_inner">
<h4>8. Increase Trust</h4>
<p>You can reinforce trust by showcasing testimonials, reviews or partners logos on your contact us pages. Social proof or any trust signal will nudge the visitors to fill out the form.</p>

<h2 class="text-center">Some Questions On CRO</h2>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-10 offset-md-1">
<div class="question_warapper">
<h5><span>Q.</span>How do you calculate the conversion rate?</h5>
<h6><span>A.</span>The conversion rate is calculated by simply diving the number of conversions by the number of total clicks. For example, if you had 20 conversions from 100 clicks, then your conversion rate  would be 20%, since 20 ÷ 100 = 20%</h6>
</div>
<div class="question_warapper">
<h5><span>Q.</span>What is a conversion on a website?</h5>
<h6><span>A.</span>Conversion could mean different things. Typically a conversion is when a user submits a form on the website or purchases a product. However, in some instances, a conversion could also mean a user clicked a button and viewed the next page in the online sales funnel.</h6>
</div>
<div class="question_warapper">
<h5><span>Q.</span>Why is Conversion Rate Optimization Important?</h5>
<h6><span>A.</span>Optimising conversion rate can have a significant impact. Let's consider this scenario where a business spends £1,000 on Google Ads and generates 100 leads at a conversion rate of 5%. The Cost Per Lead is £10.
Now with CRO lets assume we increase the conversion rate to 7% which means 140 leads which imply we reduced the Cost per Lead to £7.14. The business can continue spending the same amount of budget and enjoy more leads or reduce the budget.</h6>
</div>
<div class="question_warapper">
<h5><span>Q.</span> How do you increase conversion rate?</h5>
<h6><span>A.</span>Increasing conversions can be achieved by split testing. In a split test, we can create 2 variations of the same page. We call the first variation as control and in the other variation we add a change. E.g. we change the colour of the button from red to orange. By sending the same volume of traffic to each variant we can calculate which variation performs better over time. </h6>
</div>
<div class="question_warapper">
<h5><span>Q.</span>What is the average conversion rate?</h5>
<h6><span>A.</span>There is no fixed answer for it. Unbounce did a study by testing landing page results across various industry verticals you can check the results here.</h6>
