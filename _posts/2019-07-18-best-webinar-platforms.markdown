  ### How to create a webinar landing page?

  #### There Are Quite A Few Ways In Which You Can Setup A Landing Page For Your Webinar.
how-to-create-repeater-description:
- |-
  #### Self hosted landing pages

  If you host your website yourself and manage it directly without a content management system you can get going by either building a page in html/css and then hosting it. although it’s the most simplest way to get started but its not the most efficient.

  static web pages load up fast and you have granular control if you are a developer. however, most of the time it will be a job of a marketer to run lead generation campaigns like a webinar.
- "#### **Landing page builders**\n\nLanding page builders like unbounce, instapages,
  clickfunnels allow marketers to easily make edits and setup up split tests to increase
  conversions. \n\nall page builders offer drag and drop builders which allow non-it
  people to build pages, host and publish them without involving it. Landing page
  builders like unbounce allows users to add custom scripts. using custom scripts
  you can add add-ons like countdown timers, show proof, speaker profiles etc."
- |-
  #### **CMS based website builders**

  When it comes to managing a website the first technology which comes to mind is wordpress. yes, you can create a landing page in wordpress and style it to match your brand, it’s just landing page builders such as unbounce are designed from the ground up to host landing pages. Wordpress webinar landing pages will do most of the heavy lifting but would need a proficient web designer/developer to make edits.

  #### Traffic

  In order to generate new leads, you can run Facebook ads and drive traffic to your landing page. Although you might be tempted to call it a webinar we would recommend using something else e.g. conference, showcase, pitch night, demo day etc. I personally think the marketing world is saturated with the word webinars in general and you come up with clever ideas to stand out from the crowd.
- |-
  #### A Webinar Landing Page

  You need a dedicated landing page where you can send your traffic and we will cover this in detail today.
- |-
  #### Deliver Webinar

  To deliver an engaging and quality webinar you would need a quality tool that can deliver an engaging and reliable service. We have got this covered as well for you.
- |-
  #### Follow Up

  Follow up is a key action which will determine your lead generation success. All the leads you generate need nurturing and constant follow up to increase your chances of success.

  effective. Using the tool for a few years, we have learned many lessons and share
  the best practices for using Slack for business.
what-factors: What factors influence conversions on a webinar landing page?
what-factors-description:
- |-
  #### 1) Use a short form

  Capture only the fields you really want at this stage. You can enrich leads with additional info at a later stage. e.g. Quizzes, surveys, email follow up etc. At this stage, we would recommend capturing **Name** , **Email** and  **Phone number**.

  ![form-image-52b393.png](/uploads/form-image-52b393.png)
- |-
  #### 2) Use a countdown timer

  Countdown timers are useful to create urgency. In simple terms, you want to demonstrate Time is running out. When integrating countdown timers there are two configurations:

  **Static:**
  Set a universal cut off date for all participants. e.g. Black Friday sale day is set for everyone shopping.

  **Evergreen:**
  Instead of setting an end date for everyone, customize the date so every visitor has their own unique end date. This is based on their initial touch point. evergreen timers could be hard to configure unless you rely on some third-party apps.

  You can use countdown timers to show registration close date/time. Here are some examples of countdown timers effectively used on webinar pages:

  ![Timer.png](/uploads/Timer.png)
- "#### 3) Use a timezone converter\n\nAdding a simple timezone converter will help
  your visitors to schedule the event in their work week. I have noticed personally
  webinars held in US time zones usually mean I can view them after 6 pm UK time.
  However, I am left to do the calculations myself. \n\nBy adding a simple timezone
  converter script you can overcome this annoyance. Or even better automatically convert
  the time based on users’ timezone set by the operating system."
- |-
  #### 4) Add a can't make it section block

  Chances are visitors could be busy or might not be able to make it. By adding a secondary Call to Action which takes in their email to send out the recording once the webinar is over could also be thought of a clever lead generation channel. However, ensure you don't give to much attention to the 'Can't make it' call to action buttons as the primary focus should be to get registrations for the main webinar.
- |-
  #### 5) Show an attendee count of the previous event

  To showcase trust, authority and prestige you could list your previous webinar including participant count. 'People buy what others buy'. Using psychological triggers you increase the chances of getting more signups.
what-factors-points:
- Show scarcity by adding an attendee capacity
- Add social proof/testimonials
- Add a friendly photo/headshot of the host(s) + name and bio.
- Limit the number of seats and show proof by showing recent signups.

  ### Go Live Webinar Landing Page Checklist

  * No links to any other pages
  * Privacy Policy added, highly visible and linked
  * The logo doesn't link to the main website
  * Social icons only show social media counters and do not link to social pages
  * Date / Time correctly added including Timezones
  * Do not use the "submit" button for the form. instead, use action words such as - sign up! , count me in, register my spot.
  * Is the call to action big, bold, high contrast and does it stand out from the rest of the page?
  * Include a link on the thank you page which allows attendees to add the event on their calendar.

  ### Post Launch

reduce-churn-description: |-
  ### Webinars to reduce churn

  its true webinars can be used to educate existing customers and reduce churn and increase LTV.

  I have participated in some of the webinars hosted by adespresso. similarly, other companies like intercom use webinars to share news and latest features with their existing subscribers.

tips-description: |-
  ### Tips to make your webinars successful.

  * Choose a topic which your visitors want to learn about.


  * Choose the right tool for the job.


  * Create a dedicated webinar landing page which you can market.


  * Market your webinar landing page across various channels including social media, email and write a blog post to cover topics you will share in the webinar.


  * Share a limited time offer with the participants. As you build trust your webinar participants would be more likely to buy from you. It’s your job now to come up with offers which are enticing. You can either have a time-bound offer or one-time offer bonuses.


  * To increase the value offer an iron-clad money back guarantee to seal the deal.


  * Follow up and evaluate your webinar.

  ### Virtual Summits Vs Webinars

  ![virtual.png](/uploads/virtual.png)

  What’s the difference between virtual summits and webinars? Basically, virtual summits typically include a webinar or multiple webinars, but they also comprise of other elements such as discussions, forums, live chat, interviews, and more.

  **Webinars** (that are created with the purpose of generating leads) are typically free to attend, but **virtual summits** tend to be freemium or paid. In the freemium model, the summits are free for a short period of time (say, 24 to 72 hours), and subscribers have the option to purchase an “all-access pass” so they can download or continue viewing the materials after this time period.

### What's a webinar?

A Webinar Is Defined As A “Live, Virtual Event That Is Executed Online”. More Specifically, Webinars Are Educational Or Instructive Sessions That Include Both Audio And Visual Communication Between A Speaker And Attendees.

The Word Webinar Comes From “Web-Based Seminar”, So Webinars Are Basically Digital Seminars That Anyone Can Attend. If You’re Wondering Whether These Webinars Are As Effective As In-Person Events, The Answer Is Yes. With Webinar Software, You Can Share Slides, Interact With Your Audience Through Chat Boxes, And Even Encourage Participants To Raise Questions Using Q&A Features. In Short, Webinar Software Allow You To Mimic Real-Life Seminars To A Tee.
