description: The complete guide to high-converting landing page design
section_2-description: "\n### Why use a Landing Page?\n\n![6-post-landing-page.jpg](/images/postsimages/6-post-landing-page.jpg)\n\nMany
  businesses owners assume that the homepage of the website is effectively a landing\npage,
  as that’s where the visitors first land. Although that does make sense, landing\npages
  are usually linked to a paid campaign. \n\nHow about this simple analogy?\n\nSuppose
  you own a luxury hotel with a high-end spa centre. Now let’s say you\nare running
  billboard ads for a free membership to the spa if users join today!\nYou have this
  billboard posted all across the city and you are promoting it. The\nissue is your
  spa is half a mile away from your main hotel reception. So if you\ndo not mention
  this in your ad visitors will naturally come and see people at your\nreception only
  to find out they have to go somewhere else. Some visitors might have\nto wait and
  while doing so they would engage with others attractions in the hotel,\nfor example
  the casino table next to the live football streaming. Some of the visitors\nmight
  just leave as they wouldn’t want to take the effort to find the spa by themselves.\nNow
  take this analogy and apply to your website. If you are running paid Google\nor
  Facebook ads for a special offer or discount, would you send them to your homepage\nor
  a dedicated landing page which is relevant and assists the visitor to take an\naction?
  \n\n### What is the purpose of a landing page?\n\n![6-post-illustration.jpg](/images/postsimages/6-post-illustration.jpg)\n\nThe
  purpose a landing page is ideally to take a visitor from A -> B, although you could\nsay
  the same thing about a website. However, a typical website has 20+ pages and\nalso
  social media links etc. There are lots of ways visitors can browse the website\nand
  end up in a different section of the website and completely distracted on why\nthey
  were there in the first place. Even worse if they click on your social media\nicons
  on the website and end up checking their last notification. Effectively, on\na normal
  website a visitor can take various routes to get from A -> B. On a landing\npage
  however, there is only route.\n\n### Landing pages without navigation\n\nWeb pages
  have hyperlinks which link to other internal or external pages. As landing\npages
  are different, we do not want visitors to go to other pages or even find them.\nSo
  to decrease the pathways, we tend to remove all the hyperlinks linking to external\nsites
  including social media buttons and icons. To show social proof, you can show\nsocial
  media counters instead. Social media counters indicate the number who either\nfollow
  you on Twitter or like your page on Facebook. \n\nHowever, that doesn’t mean you
  can’t have a navigation menu at all. The answer is to have a menu system which only
  links to other sections on the homepage. \n\nAs an example, here ‘how it works’
  links to the ‘how it works’ on the same page. This reduces the changes that visitor
  might get distracted and change their journey. \n\n### Track conversions on a landing
  page\n\nIt’s important to keep a track of how many visitors a) visit your landing\npage,
  and b) do something. The do something part depends on what the objective is.\nIf
  you are generating leads by capturing email addresses, you can track the number\nof
  visitors who sign up. Based on your number of visitors and the number of conversions,\nyou
  can determine a conversion rate.\n\n![6-post-track-conversions.jpg](/images/postsimages/6-post-track-conversions.jpg)\n\nA
  conversion rate is a significant metric which you can use to create variations for\nyour
  split tests.\n\nSplit testing or A/B testing is a powerful system which allows marketers
  to test different variations of the same page. As an example, you can change the
  primary call to action button to orange from red. So effectively you have two variations
  which you can test by splitting the traffic 50:50. After a set period of time and
  enough visits, you can determine what’s known as a vital significance.Although you
  can get quite geeky and play around with numbers, if you are just starting out with
  landing page conversion, I would recommend using Unbounce, VWO or Optimizely.\n\nTo
  track conversions you can also set up goals in Google Analytics, which we covered
  extensively in our previous post about optimising your website’s conversion rate.\nWe
  also use MixPanel to track conversions. Although you can achieve the same result\nin
  Google Analytics, in Mixpanel you can create advance funnels and track them.\nI
  find them very useful especially when landing pages are on a different domain/web\nhost."

  ### How do you create a landing page and which Landing Page Generators are out there?

  To create a landing page you have quite a few options:
section-3-subheading-description: |2-

  #### 1) Go Simple\:

  You can build a lean landing page using simple HTML/CSS. However, in order to capture leads, you will need a lead capture form. You can either convert the form into PHP and add a form or you can use a Form Builder app such as LeadGenApp, Wufoo, or Paperform.

  There are few pros and cons on why you should use pure HTML/CSS static pages,
section-3-img1: images/postsimages/thumbs-up-purple.png
section-3-list-description: |2-

  - Fast load times
  - Can be easily hosted
  - Granular control over responsiveness
  - Mobile pages can be converted to AMP ones
section-3-img2: images/postsimages/thumbs-up-golden.png
section-3-list2-description: |2-

  - No editor capability
  - Requires coding skills
  - Rely on third-party apps or scripts to capture leads
  - Split testing the page could be a challenge unless you manually measure everything yourself
section-3-using-wp-heading-description: |2-

  #### 2) Using Wordpress\:

  ![6-post-wordpress.jpg](/images/postsimages/6-post-wordpress.jpg)

   Wordpress is one of the world's favourite Content Management System. We love it too. However, when it comes to Landing Pages we feel Wordpress may not be the right tool for the job. Landing pages are snappy web pages which require less heavy lifting, plugins and code libraries.

  Including a landing page inside a Wordpress website could be an overkill. Having said that though,if done cleverly, you can leverage the power of Wordpress and still build blazing fast pages.
section-3-img4: images/postsimages/thumbs-up-purple.png
section-3-list3-description: |2-

  - Wordpress community is huge; it's easy to find Wordpress developers, agencies and freelancers
  - Wordpress has tons of plugins which can be used for lots of fun and cool stuff such as split testing
  - Granular control over responsivenessWordpress pages are easy to edit
section-3-img5: images/postsimages/thumbs-up-golden.png
section-3-list4-description: |2-

  - Wordpress websites are bulky and have high load times because they usually end up loading javascript, plugin and template files. When aiming to load a page in less than a second, these factors count
  - Wordpress has extensive lists of plugins, however, sometimes outdated plugins can end up in allowing backdoor access to hackers and can compromise your website security
  - You would need a proper tech person to deal with your WordPress landing pages
  - You can use plugins to create AMP pages, but it would still need a lot of tech knowledge
section-3-web-gen-description: |2-

  #### 3) So the future, Web generators\:

  ![webgen.png](images/postsimages/webgen.png)

  Back in the day when I used Frontpage to "code" my first website, it felt lazy. It was almost cheating the system to come up with a website  without actually writing any code. After about two decades now, website generators have evolved and thankfully about time.    Unbounce is our clear favourite. Unbounce is a tool which allows marketers like us to create fast pages. Unlike other technologies, where business owners rely on seasoned developers, Unbounce         editors can be used by literally everyone. I usually say to clients, if you can use MS Word you can use Unbounce.

  Although I feel more biased with Unbounce, I would like to mention, I have had my fair share with other builders. In our agency, we have used Instapages, Clickfunnels, LeadPages and some others, but ![unbounce.jpg](/images/postsimages/unbounce.jpg) has been the popular tool across all our dev teams.
section-3-here-is-description: |2-

  #### Here is what we ![heart-icon.png](images/postsimages/heart-icon.png) about ![unbounce.png](images/postsimages/unbounce.png)
section-3-img6: images/postsimages/thumbs-up-purple.png
section-3-list5-description: |2-

  - **Speed:** You can get a landing page up and running in less than 15 minutes
  - **Configuration:** DNS mapping is quick and easy. Unlike setting up servers, Unbounce is a walk in the park
  - **Desktop/Mobile capability:** Unbounce's easy-to-use editor has a simple switch to edit the desktop and mobile versions of your webpage
  - **Forms:** Creating lead capture forms is easy. Simply drag and drop and you are ready to capture leads

  **Although there is a lot more we love about Unbounce, these are our top four reason**
section-3-img7: images/postsimages/thumbs-up-golden.png
section-3-list6-description: |2-

  - No support for the tablet version. Although tablets usually load up desktop versions, it would still be great to have tablet view/editor
  - Setting up multi-step forms is clunky and prone to error. We end up using LeadGenApp.io to create multi-step forms within Unbounce
  - Reports / Charts are not configurable and can be exported out as CSVs
  - The mobile editor could sometimes get challenging and difficult to manage especially when building complex landing pages. We end up hiding/showing layers as a hack to get around some of the layout issues
section-4-main-heading-description: "\n### How does a Landing Page work?\n\nI discussed
  why you need a landing page and how you can set it up, but I think it’s also necessary
  to understand how landing pages work.\n\n#### There are 2 things to consider:\n\n####
  1) Technical\n\nLanding pages are usually linked to paid campaigns and I strongly
  recommend using separate sub-domains to host landing pages. If you have a WordPress
  website hosted on GoDaddy for example, you can easily create a separate hosting
  account using your subdomain and use that space for your landing pages. e.g. a URL
  for a sub-domain hosting a landing page could look like: [https://deals.furniturestore.com/winter](https://deals.furniturestore.com/winter)
  \n\n![technical.jpg](images/postsimages/technical.jpg)\n\nHere \"deals\" is the
  name of the sub-domain and winter could be the name of your landing page. There
  are three benefits to using a sub-domain approach\n\n- Since the host accounts are
  different if by any chance your Wordpress site or main website is compromised your
  PPC traffic will remain unaffected as these will be linked to a separate hosting
  account\n- You can efficiently organise landing pages. E.g. a deals sub-domain could
  link to your special deals whereas a downloads sub-domain could host all your free
  resources\n- Ability to link sub-domains as CNAMES to third-party landing page editors
  like Unbounce. Once you point your CNAME to [unbouncepages.com](https://unbounce.com/)
  you are all set. Unbounce will serve all your landing page. This helps marketers
  to get away from infrastructure blockage and get things done quickly which in turn
  means items get tested quickly\n\n#### 2) Conversion Focused\n\n![conversion-focused.jpg](images/postsimages/conversion-focused.jpg)\n\nLanding
  pages work as they have one objective. If we break it down here is the journey.\n\nA
  visitor sees an ad on either Facebook or as part of Google's sponsored search results.
  The ad has an eye-catching headline and a sub-heading/description which usually
  makes a promise. The ad copy entices the user to click. When the user clicks the
  ad and visits the landing page. The landing page needs to do a few things"
section-4-sub-heading-description: |2-

  ##### Be relevant

  The landing page needs to complement the ad copy. If the ad text is not relevant to the landing page, users will bounce back. To avoid any ambiguity you should match the headline with the copy of your ad copy.
section-4-sub-heading2-description: |2-

  ##### Keep the Promise

  Ad copies are enticing and set the stage where you make a promise to the visitor. Once the ad gets clicked, you need to fulfil the promise with your landing page. If a user clicked an ad to get 20% off on a product, they should see a landing page which exactly lets them get the deal. Many click-bait websites do not fulfil the promise and leave the visitors in anguish and disgust.
section-4-sub-heading3-description: |2-

  ##### Build trust

  Chances are that visitors might not have heard about your brand. Your job is to build trust using the right elements; social proof, testimonials, partner logos and badges all assist in increasing confidence. You can also use your social media like or follower counter badge to showcase your brand.
section-4-sub-heading4-description: |2-

  ##### Define conversion

  Whether it’s visitors signing up on a form or clicking  through to a squeeze page. Whatever the objective is set for the landing page, you need to track the conversions and have reports which give you cost per conversions   This simple metric can calculate your return on investment if you know how much a lead is worth to you.
section-4-bottom-heading-description: "###### websites and website homepages are full
  of distractions and lack the laser focus. So next time when you think of spending
  money via the paid campaign, think landing pages"
section-5-main-heading-description: "\n#### Is Landing Page a Website?\n\n![landing-page-a-website.jpg](/images/postsimages/landing-page-a-website.jpg)\n\nThe
  answer is yes, but think of landing pages as\na 1-page website which has their audience
  linked to a specific marketing campaign.\nIf you compare that to your homepage on
  your website well, it’s pretty public, and\nany user can access it. Landing pages
  tend to load faster as they are typically\noutside the website eco-system.\n\n####
  When to Build a Landing Page?\n\n![build-a-landing-page.jpg](/images/postsimages/build-a-landing-page.jpg)\n\nIf
  you are planning to capture emails in exchange for a free resource like an ebook
  or whitepaper, then landing pages would be perfect for the job.\n\nIf you are planning
  to run a campaign and don’t want to send your highly targeted audience to your homepage,
  then the answer is - Yes you need a landing page.\n\nIf you are running Facebook
  ads and want to share an educational post and want the visitor to click through
  to the next page in your funnel, then yes I would recommend an advertorial click-through
  landing page. \n\nIf you want to sell a specific product and want to focus on driving
  sales, then a landing page with a simple buy button will do the job.\n\n####  Can
  I have a Landing Page without a website?\n\n![landing-page-without-website.jpg](images/postsimages/landing-page-without-website.jpg)\n\nYes!
  You can either create a landing page directly on your main www root domain, or you
  can link your paid traffic to pages hosted on your subdomain. If you are worried
  that visitors would want to check out your website and you are still setting it
  up, the simplest solution is to have a redirect in place which links the www site
  back to the landing page.\n\nIn tools like Unbounce, for example, you can set up
  a naked domain, which implies you can host your Unbounce landing pages on the root
  domain. You will need to point both an ‘A’ record and a CNAME record to Unbounce.
  You can apply the same principle to the majority of landing page generators. \n\nHaving
  a website is great, but if you are a startup and want to test your idea by using
  a landing page as your MVP (Minimal Viable Product), then you can easily build a
  landing page without needing a proper dedicated website.\n\n#### Can I use a landing
  page for SEO?\n\n![landing-page-for-seo.jpg](images/postsimages/landing-page-for-seo.jpg)\n\nIf
  you have a website and would like to rank for particular keywords, yes I would recommend
  using dedicated landing pages for top keywords/ services/products.\n\nIf you search
  for iPhone in Google, the first organic result is the correct landing page for iPhone.
  Google understands and learns with the context that [https://www.apple.com/uk/iphone/](https://www.apple.com/uk/iphone/)
  is more relevant to iPhone than [https://www.apple.com/uk/mac](https://www.apple.com/uk/mac).\n\nSome
  people might argue these are normal child pages on a website and shouldn't be viewed
  as a landing page. I would say people who are searching for these keywords are further
  down in the buying journey funnel; they have a problem which they are trying to
  solve."
section-5-img-description: |2-

  ![tip.png](images/postsimages/tip.png)

  ### The pages they land on should have

  - **Clear concise information about the product/service**
  - **Social Proof**
  - **Product Photos etc**
  - **Clear call to action on what the next logical step the customer should take**
  - **Videos or Demo GIFs**
section-5-sub-heading-description: |2-

  ### Should I host the SEO landing page on the same host as the website or on a different server?

  There is much debate on whether SEO landing pages should be on the same server as the main website. Our take is to host the SEO landing pages on the same host.


  Here are a few reasons:


  -The link juice from the main site stays within the site. This means the SEO pages will also rank and have the same Domain Authority as rest of the website.


  -If you move them away on a different server, then they act as "doorway" pages which almost  borderlines the black hat SEO strategy overused in the early days of SEO

  ###### “We recommend putting your best product/service pages in the top navigation and quick to find areas on the websites. These pages should be treated as landing pages where you aim to convert visitors to the next step in their buyer journey”
section-6-sub-heading-description: |2-

  ##### 1) Click-through Landing Page

  A click-through landing page is a particular page which has one purpose - Make the user click-through to the next page in the funnel. You might be thinking at this point why bother?

  Here are some reasons on why you would want to have a Click-through page in your marketing funnel:

  ![laptop.jpg](images/postsimages/laptop.jpg)

  ####  1. Warm up visitors

  If you are running ads and promoting an e-commerce product you can have a click-through page which would then link to the product where visitors can buy. However, at the click-through page level you can address all things which will allow visitors to make a purchase decision. Adding a video on a click-through can be very effective as it would educate the customers and can answer any objections.

  ####  2. To guage intent

  We use click-through pages as part of online sales funnels.  To generate awareness we typically have a blog post. The post has an offer/freebie at the end of the post. The post has no other links on the page so acts as a click-through page. The page we link to is typically a lead generation page which gives away a free resource in exchange for an email. However, to allow visitors to become problem aware and get more information about the product or service you are selling, you can further break the steps to establish trust, leadership and market positioning.
  A series of click-through pages can help you achieve it.

  Ideal for: B2B / B2C

  Raising Awareness, Warming up Paid traffic visitors.
section-6-sub-heading2-description: "\n#### 2) Leadgen Landing Page\n\nA lead gen
  (lead generation) landing page has a form to capture lead details in exchange for
  a freebie. A lead gen landing page can be used in various stages in the content
  funnel to generate leads. However, the most common element is to generate leads.\n\n![laptop-2jpg](images/postsimages/laptop-2.jpg)\n\n####
  1. Generate leads via lead gen landing pages for give-away resources like:\n\n-
  eBooks\n- Whitepapers \n- Case studies   \n- Email course\n\n#### 2. Enrich leads
  already generated. If your leads are further down in the sales funnel, for example
  a lead is now tagged as a hot prospect, you can make them sales-ready by sharing
  resources like: \n\n- Free consultations\n- Free Demo/Trials\n- Email courses etc\n\nAt
  this stage in their journey, as you have already collected their email address,
  you can ask further info like:\n\nCompany size, industry, and the contact details
  of the person who is going to book the free consultation/trial. There are some enterprises
  solutions available which help in enriching client data e.g. [Full Contact](https://www.fullcontact.com/)
  \n\nIdeal for: B2B"
section-6-sub-heading3-description: "\n#### 3) Microsite\n\nThink of micro-sites as
  bunch of closely knit landing pages. Microsites are powerful if you are running
  a campaign and want to leverage 2-3 pages rather than just 1 landing page. However,
  these 2-3 pages are interlinked and the visitor journey doesn’t link to the main
  website. Micro-sites are useful were you want to warm up visitors first and once
  they build some trust and rapport you can then send them to the lead gen page.\n\nHere
  is a scenario where a microsite would work better than a full blown website or a
  single website.\n\nIf you are running Facebook ads to an audience who might be problem
  aware but not solution / product aware, you can talk about the problem in the ad
  and point it to a content article on your micro-site. The content article can link
  to a lead magnet which could offer a free ebook/template/swipe file etc and finally
  the thank you page where  you could link to calendly and your new leads to book
  appointments with you. All done within a micro-site completely independant to your
  main website.\n\n#### Here is what we used in the above example:\n\n{:.ordered-list-style}\n1.
  1  Content page - Click-through page\n \n2. 2  Free Resource - LeadGen page  \n
  \n3. 3  Thank you page - Convert a lead into a prospect by offering a simple solution
  to book in a call.\n \nThe above pages when connected together work as a Sales Funnel
  which you can tag using Facebook Pixel and know exactly where people drop off to
  fix the leaks.\n\n![microsite.png](images/postsimages/microsite.png) \n\nIdeal for
  B2B\""

  ### Who designs Landing Pages?

  You can hire conversion focused web designers and developers. Although many designers build creative layouts, it’s sometimes a challenge to get it right. As an agency, we specialise in creating landing pages. We use tools like Unbounce, HotJar, Mixpanel etc. to develop split tests.

  We design all landing pages from scratch. Every landing page is different as each page has a different objective and when mixed with business value proposition you want a landing page which meets your goals and takes your message to your target audience. We ask all of our clients to fill in a landing page design brief which helps us to build a persona. We estimate the time and cost and send over the landing page design proposal.

A landing page is a web-page which is different from the rest of the pages on the website. A landing page has an objective. Whether it’s capturing contact details or linking to a product page etc. landing pages can use for a variety of actions. I will go through them in detail later.
