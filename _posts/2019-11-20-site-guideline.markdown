In a world where mobile devices are dominating internet usage, many businesses are asking themselves whether they should embrace the change and implement Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) as mobile landing pages.

But is it really worth it in the long run? AMP pages are beginning to shape the way that people use the internet. From news and media outlets to online shopping providers, AMP has seen a surge in popularity. However, many businesses are still hesitant to make the change. Are they justified? 

In order to answer the question as to whether or not AMP is worth the effort to improve conversion rates, we will investigate what is involved, how it affects businesses and the pros and cons of using them.

## What is AMP?

Before you decide whether or not to use AMP, you must first understand what it is. 

AMP is a set of coding guidelines and components that builds a ghost version of your original website. Designed specifically for mobile devices to reduce load times, AMP compiles a version of your website that is faster and more efficient than the original.

Essentially, it presents a stripped-down version of a full website, so that information can be loaded faster for mobile devices especially for optimising google ads.

AMP is a freeware library endorsed by Google, meaning that the code is readily available to any business that wishes to utilise it within their website. Initially, the main draw factor for AMP was the increased loading speed - which would offer better usability and improve SEO rankings. 

However, there has been criticised by many businesses that AMP pages are cached by Google, who would no longer need to request the page from your server, but could instead publish it from its own cache. This has caused some hesitation among developers.
