feature-type-5-description: 'The Call-To-Action (CTA) is highly critical for the success
  of [landing pages](https://www.apexure.com/unbounce-landing-page-designer/). For
  the Restaurant landing page, we used a simple CTA "Join Now" and added a catchphrase
  below "Claim your free month of promotion from Sponsored Dishes". This keeps the
  offer simple while adding urgency and incentives at the same time.
