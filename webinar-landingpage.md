  One of the strong and powerful images you can use for your Webinar Landing pages are photos with the host and audience. Also try putting captions under your images. People almost always read the captions under images.

  For guest speakers you can add their short bio with their photos.
  You can also include LinkedIn profile icons (which can link to their linkedin profiles in a popup) to showcase their credibility.
