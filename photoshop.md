feature-type-1-description: 'All our clients have bespoke requirements. We start by
  sending out a brief which helps us understand the vision, objectives, target audience
  and the overall brand. We set out to create a custom wireframe in Balsamiq which
  we then showcase to the client via Notable. Once the client is happy with the structure
  we then start mocking up the page in Photoshop.

feature-type-2-heading: Why Photoshop?
feature-type-2-description: Photoshop is still one of the best tools out there for
  UI/UX work. Although we have experience in Adobe XD and Sketch. We use Photoshop
  because Photoshop files (PSDs) are easily compatible across Windows/MacOS. We work
  with devs in-house and around the world. By providing artwork and design files as
  PSDs we support the majority community.

feature-type-4-description: "Although Unbounce has a great editor which is easy to
  use and powerful enough to create great designs. We find it easier to design everything
  in Photoshop first as it allows us total freedom and makes it easier for us to collaborate
  with our clients at an early stage. \n"

feature-type-6-heading: Social Proof
feature-type-6-description: A reinforcing customer quote or testimonial with real
  photos. If you don't have testimonials can you prepare a stat which has the numbers
  of users/customers. As shown by research, people really like looking at human faces
  on the web, and testimonials are more likely to be trusted when they include a photo
  of the person quoting it. You could also include video testimonials from your top
  customers and showcase them on your page.

  your brand across channels like Facebook or Twitter. Those numbers can’t be faked. '
