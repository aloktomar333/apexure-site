feature-type-1-heading: 'Strong Headline '
feature-type-1-description: With a charity landing page you bring the right message
  across from the very beginning. The aim should be to introduce high attention grabbing
  headlines and subheadings that stands out. You can also use case studies of people
  / projects you have undertaken who have been impacted by your work. This will have
  a positive impact as donors always doubt whether their money is well spent.

feature-type-2-description: A reinforcing donor quote or testimonial with real photos.
  If you don't have testimonials can you prepare a stat which has the numbers of donors.
  Testimonials are more likely to be trusted when they include pictures of even video
  material of the person. A video can be a great way to showcase credibility of your
  charity.

feature-type-3-heading: Call To Action Button
feature-type-3-description: 'The Call-to-Action is the message that should entice
  people to take an action. If you are taking payments on your landing page, have
  donation buttons for different amounts in place. E.g. Donate £50, Donate $100 etc.
  PayPal as payment solution allows you to let donors set the amount that they are
  willing to spend. '

feature-type-4-heading: Include a Phone number
feature-type-4-description: Many times donation organisations do not include direct
  phone numbers. Adding contact numbers on your landing pages will instil trust and
  confidence in your charity or non-profit organisation.

feature-type-5-heading: Clear and unambiguous copy
feature-type-5-description: Last but least, the content of your landing page should
  be clear and concise across the entire page. Running a donation campaign is all
  about conveying trust and credibility. By being fully transparent and providing
  specific information, you will increase your chances of making the online campaign
  for your charity a success

feature-type-6-heading: Social Proof
feature-type-6-description: A reinforcing customer quote or testimonial with real
  photos. If you don't have testimonials can you prepare a stat which has the numbers
  of users/customers. As shown by research, people really like looking at human faces
  on the web, and testimonials are more likely to be trusted when they include a photo
  of the person quoting it. You could also include video testimonials from your top
  customers and showcase them on your page.
