feature-type-3-heading: Dumbing it down
feature-type-3-description: By asking a simple question at the start of the form,
  you can drive visitors to take action. E.g. for a recruitment company a simple question
  could be; What kind of role are you looking for? Choices Full-time, part-time. Since
  everybody looking for a job will know the answer and it won't require them to think
  too hard, they would get their foot in the door by simply clicking on the choice.
  Once users go through the first step they are more likely to go through the next
  ones and eventually filling out the form.

feature-type-4-description: You can get a custom multi-step landing page with conditional
  logic for Unbounce, Instapages, Clickfunnels or HTML pages. With conditional logic,

  size you can ask them a different question. We have build complex conditional logic
